## Future project ideas

With the new skills I've been amounting recently, I have already seen a couple of opportunities to practice. First, I can work with my mom and design something that showcases her work as a cookie creator as well as drive another way for potential clients to contact her. 

Next, I can see a couple of other projects that can be implemented as I further my knowledge in JavaScript. I can imagine an Online Caddie to suggest a golf club selection given a specific yardage. With that it would be great to implement some ideas that are similar to what 18Birdies and Arcos are doing. 

Another possibility I can see is a Horn education website that can be used as a resource for new/seasoned Horn students looking for a one-stop place for some help. I would include a finger chart at first and then flesh it out to recommend some warm-up drills and technique studies for specific etudes ("This etude requires mastery in x, y, and z. Check out these warm-ups/studies for some practice!)
