                    <h2>Music Educator | Brass Musician</h2>
                    <p>Growing up, I was always involved in either a sport or musical activity. After a decade of focusing on baseball, I ended up anchoring myself in learning how to play the Horn. Despite the fact that I was VERY reluctant to try something new, I ended up enjoying of performing music with a wind ensemble (thanks, Mom).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Being able to play the Horn has afforded me some amazing opportunities and they are memories that I will never forget. A focal point in my past has been the amount of traveling I did while performing with the Bluecoats (2010) and Boston Crusaders (2011-2012) Drum and Bugle Corps. In addition to being a performer with these groups, I was also able to serve marching students as an educator with the Guardians Drum and Bugle Corps (2016-2018). This experience has been valuable as I continue to educate Band students at Moises E. Molina High School in Dallas ISD.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With my work as a Developer, I will help in creating and optomizing online tools to further students' music education and gain access to the same opportunities that I was able to experience through music.</p>
